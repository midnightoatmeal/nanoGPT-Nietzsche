      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Zarathustra” is my brother’s most personal work; it is the history of\n",
      "his most individual experiences, of his friendships, ideals, raptures,\n",
      "bitterest disappointments and sorrows. Above it all, however, there\n",
      "soars, transfiguring it, the image of his greatest hopes and remotest\n",
      "aims. My brother had the figure of Zarathustra in his mind from his very\n",
      "earliest youth: he once told me that even as a child he had dreamt of\n",
      "him. At different periods in his life, he would call this haunter of his\n",
      "dreams by different names; “but in the end,” he declares in a note on\n",
      "the subject, “I had to do a PERSIAN the honour of identifying him with\n",
      "this creature of my fancy. Persians were the first to take a broad and\n",
      "comprehensive view of history. Every series of evolutions, according\n",
      "to them, was presided over by a prophet; and every prophet had his\n",
      "‘Hazar,’—his dynasty of a thousand years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All Zarathustra’s views, as also his personality, were early conceptions\n",
      "of my brother’s mind. Whoever reads his posthumously published writings\n",
      "for the years 1869–82 with care, will constantly meet with passages\n",
      "suggestive of Zarathustra’s thoughts and doctrines. For instance, the\n",
      "ideal of the Superman is put forth quite clearly in all his writings\n",
      "during the years 1873–75; and in “We Philologists”, the following\n",
      "remarkable observations occur:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can one praise and glorify a nation as a whole?—Even among the\n",
      "Greeks, it was the INDIVIDUALS that counted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Greeks are interesting and extremely important because they reared\n",
      "such a vast number of great individuals. How was this possible? The\n",
      "question is one which ought to be studied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am interested only in the relations of a people to the rearing of\n",
      "the individual man, and among the Greeks the conditions were unusually\n",
      "favourable for the development of the individual; not by any means owing\n",
      "to the goodness of the people, but because of the struggles of their\n",
      "evil instincts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“WITH THE HELP OF FAVOURABLE MEASURES GREAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE REARED\n",
      "WHO WOULD BE BOTH DIFFERENT FROM AND HIGHER THAN THOSE WHO HERETOFORE\n",
      "HAVE OWED THEIR EXISTENCE TO MERE CHANCE. Here we may still be hopeful:\n",
      "in the rearing of exceptional men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The notion of rearing the Superman is only a new form of an ideal\n",
      "Nietzsche already had in his youth, that “THE OBJECT OF MANKIND SHOULD\n",
      "LIE IN ITS HIGHEST INDIVIDUALS” (or, as he writes in “Schopenhauer as\n",
      "Educator”: “Mankind ought constantly to be striving to produce great\n",
      "men—this and nothing else is its duty.”) But the ideals he most revered\n",
      "in those days are no longer held to be the highest types of men. No,\n",
      "around this future ideal of a coming humanity—the Superman—the poet\n",
      "spread the veil of becoming. Who can tell to what glorious heights man\n",
      "can still ascend? That is why, after having tested the worth of our\n",
      "noblest ideal—that of the Saviour, in the light of the new valuations,\n",
      "the poet cries with passionate emphasis in “Zarathustra”:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never yet hath there been a Superman. Naked have I seen both of them,\n",
      "the greatest and the smallest man:—\n",
      "\n",
      "All-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily even the greatest\n",
      "found I—all-too-human!”—\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase “the rearing of the Superman,” has very often been\n",
      "misunderstood. By the word “rearing,” in this case, is meant the act of\n",
      "modifying by means of new and higher values—values which, as laws and\n",
      "guides of conduct and opinion, are now to rule over mankind. In general\n",
      "the doctrine of the Superman can only be understood correctly in\n",
      "conjunction with other ideas of the author’s, such as:—the Order\n",
      "of Rank, the Will to Power, and the Transvaluation of all Values. He\n",
      "assumes that Christianity, as a product of the resentment of the botched\n",
      "and the weak, has put in ban all that is beautiful, strong, proud, and\n",
      "powerful, in fact all the qualities resulting from strength, and that,\n",
      "in consequence, all forces which tend to promote or elevate life have\n",
      "been seriously undermined. Now, however, a new table of valuations\n",
      "must be placed over mankind—namely, that of the strong, mighty, and\n",
      "magnificent man, overflowing with life and elevated to his zenith—the\n",
      "Superman, who is now put before us with overpowering passion as the\n",
      "aim of our life, hope, and will. And just as the old system of valuing,\n",
      "which only extolled the qualities favourable to the weak, the suffering,\n",
      "and the oppressed, has succeeded in producing a weak, suffering, and\n",
      "“modern” race, so this new and reversed system of valuing ought to rear\n",
      "a healthy, strong, lively, and courageous type, which would be a glory\n",
      "to life itself. Stated briefly, the leading principle of this new system\n",
      "of valuing would be: “All that proceeds from power is good, all that\n",
      "springs from weakness is bad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This type must not be regarded as a fanciful figure: it is not a\n",
      "nebulous hope which is to be realised at some indefinitely remote\n",
      "period, thousands of years hence; nor is it a new species (in the\n",
      "Darwinian sense) of which we can know nothing, and which it would\n",
      "therefore be somewhat absurd to strive after. But it is meant to be\n",
      "a possibility which men of the present could realise with all their\n",
      "spiritual and physical energies, provided they adopted the new values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author of “Zarathustra” never lost sight of that egregious example\n",
      "of a transvaluation of all values through Christianity, whereby the\n",
      "whole of the deified mode of life and thought of the Greeks, as well as\n",
      "strong Romedom, was almost annihilated or transvalued in a comparatively\n",
      "short time. Could not a rejuvenated Graeco-Roman system of valuing (once\n",
      "it had been refined and made more profound by the schooling which\n",
      "two thousand years of Christianity had provided) effect another such\n",
      "revolution within a calculable period of time, until that glorious type\n",
      "of manhood shall finally appear which is to be our new faith and hope,\n",
      "and in the creation of which Zarathustra exhorts us to participate?\n",
      "\n",
      "In his private notes on the subject the author uses the expression\n",
      "“Superman” (always in the singular, by-the-bye), as signifying “the most\n",
      "thoroughly well-constituted type,” as opposed to “modern man”; above\n",
      "all, however, he designates Zarathustra himself as an example of the\n",

      "bolder and merrier than all healthiness hitherto. He whose soul\n",
      "longeth to experience the whole range of hitherto recognised values\n",
      "and desirabilities, and to circumnavigate all the coasts of this ideal\n",
      "‘Mediterranean Sea’, who, from the adventures of his most personal\n",
      "experience, wants to know how it feels to be a conqueror, and discoverer\n",
      "of the ideal—as likewise how it is with the artist, the saint, the\n",
      "legislator, the sage, the scholar, the devotee, the prophet, and the\n",
      "godly non-conformist of the old style:—requires one thing above all\n",
      "for that purpose, GREAT HEALTHINESS—such healthiness as one not only\n",
      "possesses, but also constantly acquires and must acquire, because one\n",
      "unceasingly sacrifices it again, and must sacrifice it!—And now, after\n",
      "having been long on the way in this fashion, we Argonauts of the ideal,\n",
      "more courageous perhaps than prudent, and often enough shipwrecked\n",
      "and brought to grief, nevertheless dangerously healthy, always healthy\n",
      "again,—it would seem as if, in recompense for it all, that we have a\n",
      "still undiscovered country before us, the boundaries of which no one\n",
      "has yet seen, a beyond to all countries and corners of the ideal known\n",
      "hitherto, a world so over-rich in the beautiful, the strange, the\n",
      "questionable, the frightful, and the divine, that our curiosity as well\n",
      "as our thirst for possession thereof, have got out of hand—alas! that\n",
      "nothing will now any longer satisfy us!—\n",
      "\n",
      "“How could we still be content with THE MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY\n",
      "after such outlooks, and with such a craving in our conscience and\n",
      "consciousness? Sad enough; but it is unavoidable that we should look\n",
      "on the worthiest aims and hopes of the man of the present-day with\n",
      "ill-concealed amusement, and perhaps should no longer look at them.\n",
      "Another ideal runs on before us, a strange, tempting ideal full of\n",
      "danger, to which we should not like to persuade any one, because we\n",
      "do not so readily acknowledge any one’s RIGHT THERETO: the ideal of\n",
      "a spirit who plays naively (that is to say involuntarily and from\n",
      "overflowing abundance and power) with everything that has hitherto\n",
      "been called holy, good, intangible, or divine; to whom the loftiest\n",
      "conception which the people have reasonably made their measure of value,\n",
      "would already practically imply danger, ruin, abasement, or at least\n",
      "relaxation, blindness, or temporary self-forgetfulness; the ideal of\n",
      "a humanly superhuman welfare and benevolence, which will often enough\n",
      "appear INHUMAN, for example, when put alongside of all past seriousness\n",
      "on earth, and alongside of all past solemnities in bearing, word, tone,\n",
      "look, morality, and pursuit, as their truest involuntary parody—and\n",
      "WITH which, nevertheless, perhaps THE GREAT SERIOUSNESS only commences,\n",

      "Although the figure of Zarathustra and a large number of the leading\n",
      "thoughts in this work had appeared much earlier in the dreams and\n",
      "writings of the author, “Thus Spake Zarathustra” did not actually come\n",
      "into being until the month of August 1881 in Sils Maria; and it was the\n",
      "idea of the Eternal Recurrence of all things which finally induced my\n",
      "brother to set forth his new views in poetic language. In regard to his\n",
      "first conception of this idea, his autobiographical sketch, “Ecce Homo”,\n",
      "written in the autumn of 1888, contains the following passage:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The fundamental idea of my work—namely, the Eternal Recurrence of\n",
      "all things—this highest of all possible formulae of a Yea-saying\n",
      "philosophy, first occurred to me in August 1881. I made a note of the\n",
      "thought on a sheet of paper, with the postscript: 6,000 feet beyond\n",
      "men and time! That day I happened to be wandering through the woods\n",
      "alongside of the lake of Silvaplana, and I halted beside a huge,\n",
      "pyramidal and towering rock not far from Surlei. It was then that the\n",
      "thought struck me. Looking back now, I find that exactly two months\n",
      "previous to this inspiration, I had had an omen of its coming in the\n",
      "form of a sudden and decisive alteration in my tastes—more particularly\n",
      "in music. It would even be possible to consider all ‘Zarathustra’ as a\n",
      "musical composition. At all events, a very necessary condition in its\n",
      "production was a renaissance in myself of the art of hearing. In a small\n",
      "mountain resort (Recoaro) near Vicenza, where I spent the spring of\n",
      "1881, I and my friend and Maestro, Peter Gast—also one who had been\n",
      "born again—discovered that the phoenix music that hovered over us, wore\n",
      "lighter and brighter plumes than it had done theretofore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "During the month of August 1881 my brother resolved to reveal the\n",
      "teaching of the Eternal Recurrence, in dithyrambic and psalmodic form,\n",
      "through the mouth of Zarathustra. Among the notes of this period, we\n",
      "found a page on which is written the first definite plan of “Thus Spake\n",
      "Zarathustra”:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“MIDDAY AND ETERNITY.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“GUIDE-POSTS TO A NEW WAY OF LIVING.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beneath this is written:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Zarathustra born on lake Urmi; left his home in his thirtieth year,\n",
      "went into the province of Aria, and, during ten years of solitude in the\n",
      "mountains, composed the Zend-Avesta.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The sun of knowledge stands once more at midday; and the serpent\n",

      "brethren.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In that summer of 1881, my brother, after many years of steadily\n",
      "declining health, began at last to rally, and it is to this first gush\n",
      "of the recovery of his once splendid bodily condition that we owe not\n",
      "only “The Gay Science”, which in its mood may be regarded as a prelude\n",
      "to “Zarathustra”, but also “Zarathustra” itself. Just as he was\n",
      "beginning to recuperate his health, however, an unkind destiny brought\n",
      "him a number of most painful personal experiences. His friends caused\n",
      "him many disappointments, which were the more bitter to him, inasmuch as\n",
      "he regarded friendship as such a sacred institution; and for the first\n",
      "time in his life he realised the whole horror of that loneliness to\n",

      "understand him, to whom he would be able to say all, and whom he\n",

      "youth onwards. Now, however, that the way he had chosen grew ever more\n",
      "perilous and steep, he found nobody who could follow him: he therefore\n",
      "created a perfect friend for himself in the ideal form of a majestic\n",

      "Whether my brother would ever have written “Thus Spake Zarathustra”\n",
      " according to the first plan sketched in the summer of 1881, if he\n",
      "had not had the disappointments already referred to, is now an idle\n",
      "question; but perhaps where “Zarathustra” is concerned, we may also say\n",

      "My brother writes as follows about the origin of the first part of\n",
      "“Zarathustra”:—“In the winter of 1882–83, I was living on the charming\n",
      "little Gulf of Rapallo, not far from Genoa, and between Chiavari and\n",
      "Cape Porto Fino. My health was not very good; the winter was cold and\n",
      "exceptionally rainy; and the small inn in which I lived was so close\n",
      "to the water that at night my sleep would be disturbed if the sea were\n",
      "high. These circumstances were surely the very reverse of favourable;\n",
      "and yet in spite of it all, and as if in demonstration of my belief that\n",
      "everything decisive comes to life in spite of every obstacle, it was\n",
      "precisely during this winter and in the midst of these unfavourable\n",
      "circumstances that my ‘Zarathustra’ originated. In the morning I used to\n",
      "start out in a southerly direction up the glorious road to Zoagli, which\n",
      "rises aloft through a forest of pines and gives one a view far out into\n",
      "the sea. In the afternoon, as often as my health permitted, I walked\n",
      "round the whole bay from Santa Margherita to beyond Porto Fino. This\n",
      "spot was all the more interesting to me, inasmuch as it was so dearly\n",
      "loved by the Emperor Frederick III. In the autumn of 1886 I chanced to\n",
      "be there again when he was revisiting this small, forgotten world\n",
      "of happiness for the last time. It was on these two roads that all\n",
      "‘Zarathustra’ came to me, above all Zarathustra himself as a type;—I\n",
      "ought rather to say that it was on these walks that these ideas waylaid\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part of “Zarathustra” was written in about ten days—that is\n",
      "to say, from the beginning to about the middle of February 1883. “The\n",
      "last lines were written precisely in the hallowed hour when Richard\n",
      "Wagner gave up the ghost in Venice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With the exception of the ten days occupied in composing the first part\n",
      "of this book, my brother often referred to this winter as the hardest\n",
      "and sickliest he had ever experienced. He did not, however, mean thereby\n",
      "that his former disorders were troubling him, but that he was suffering\n",
      "from a severe attack of influenza which he had caught in Santa\n",
      "Margherita, and which tormented him for several weeks after his arrival\n",
      "in Genoa. As a matter of fact, however, what he complained of most was\n",
      "his spiritual condition—that indescribable forsakenness—to which he\n",
      "gives such heartrending expression in “Zarathustra”. Even the reception\n",
      "which the first part met with at the hands of friends and acquaintances\n",
      "was extremely disheartening: for almost all those to whom he presented\n",
      "copies of the work misunderstood it. “I found no one ripe for many of my\n",
      "thoughts; the case of ‘Zarathustra’ proves that one can speak with the\n",
      "utmost clearness, and yet not be heard by any one.” My brother was very\n",
      "much discouraged by the feebleness of the response he was given, and as\n",
      "he was striving just then to give up the practice of taking hydrate\n",
      "of chloral—a drug he had begun to take while ill with influenza,—the\n",
      "following spring, spent in Rome, was a somewhat gloomy one for him.\n",
      "He writes about it as follows:—“I spent a melancholy spring in Rome,\n",
      "where I only just managed to live,—and this was no easy matter. This\n",
      "city, which is absolutely unsuited to the poet-author of ‘Zarathustra’,\n",
      "and for the choice of which I was not responsible, made me inordinately\n",
      "miserable. I tried to leave it. I wanted to go to Aquila—the opposite\n",
      "of Rome in every respect, and actually founded in a spirit of enmity\n",
      "towards that city (just as I also shall found a city some day), as a\n",
      "memento of an atheist and genuine enemy of the Church—a person very\n",
      "closely related to me,—the great Hohenstaufen, the Emperor Frederick\n",
      "II. But Fate lay behind it all: I had to return again to Rome. In the\n",
      "end I was obliged to be satisfied with the Piazza Barberini, after I had\n",
      "exerted myself in vain to find an anti-Christian quarter. I fear that\n",
      "on one occasion, to avoid bad smells as much as possible, I actually\n",
      "inquired at the Palazzo del Quirinale whether they could not provide a\n",
      "quiet room for a philosopher. In a chamber high above the Piazza just\n",
      "mentioned, from which one obtained a general view of Rome and could\n",
      "hear the fountains plashing far below, the loneliest of all songs\n",
      "was composed—‘The Night-Song’. About this time I was obsessed by an\n",
      "unspeakably sad melody, the refrain of which I recognised in the words,\n",
      "‘dead through immortality.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "We remained somewhat too long in Rome that spring, and what with the\n",
      "effect of the increasing heat and the discouraging circumstances already\n",
      "described, my brother resolved not to write any more, or in any case,\n",
      "not to proceed with “Zarathustra”, although I offered to relieve him\n",
      "of all trouble in connection with the proofs and the publisher. When,\n",
      "however, we returned to Switzerland towards the end of June, and he\n",
      "found himself once more in the familiar and exhilarating air of the\n",
      "mountains, all his joyous creative powers revived, and in a note to me\n",
      "announcing the dispatch of some manuscript, he wrote as follows: “I have\n",
      "engaged a place here for three months: forsooth, I am the greatest fool\n",
      "to allow my courage to be sapped from me by the climate of Italy. Now\n",
      "and again I am troubled by the thought: WHAT NEXT? My ‘future’ is the\n",
      "darkest thing in the world to me, but as there still remains a great\n",

      "\n",
      "The second part of “Zarathustra” was written between the 26th of June\n",
      "and the 6th July. “This summer, finding myself once more in the sacred\n",
      "place where the first thought of ‘Zarathustra’ flashed across my mind,\n",

      "He often used to speak of the ecstatic mood in which he wrote\n",

      "into his mind, and how he would note them down hastily in a note-book\n",
      "from which he would transcribe them on his return, sometimes working\n",
      "till midnight. He says in a letter to me: “You can have no idea of the\n",
      "vehemence of such composition,” and in “Ecce Homo” (autumn 1888) he\n",

      "“—Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion\n",
      "of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration? If\n",
      "not, I will describe it. If one had the smallest vestige of superstition\n",
      "in one, it would hardly be possible to set aside completely the idea\n",
      "that one is the mere incarnation, mouthpiece or medium of an almighty\n",
      "power. The idea of revelation in the sense that something becomes\n",
      "suddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy,\n",
      "which profoundly convulses and upsets one—describes simply the matter\n",
      "of fact. One hears—one does not seek; one takes—one does not ask\n",
      "who gives: a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning, it comes with\n",
      "necessity, unhesitatingly—I have never had any choice in the matter.\n",
      "There is an ecstasy such that the immense strain of it is sometimes\n",
      "relaxed by a flood of tears, along with which one’s steps either rush\n",
      "or involuntarily lag, alternately. There is the feeling that one is\n",
      "completely out of hand, with the very distinct consciousness of an\n",
      "endless number of fine thrills and quiverings to the very toes;—there\n",
      "is a depth of happiness in which the painfullest and gloomiest do not\n",
      "operate as antitheses, but as conditioned, as demanded in the sense of\n",
      "necessary shades of colour in such an overflow of light. There is an\n",
      "instinct for rhythmic relations which embraces wide areas of forms\n",
      "(length, the need of a wide-embracing rhythm, is almost the measure of\n",
      "the force of an inspiration, a sort of counterpart to its pressure and\n",
      "tension). Everything happens quite involuntarily, as if in a tempestuous\n",
      "outburst of freedom, of absoluteness, of power and divinity. The\n",
      "involuntariness of the figures and similes is the most remarkable\n",
      "thing; one loses all perception of what constitutes the figure and\n",
      "what constitutes the simile; everything seems to present itself as\n",
      "the readiest, the correctest and the simplest means of expression.\n",
      "It actually seems, to use one of Zarathustra’s own phrases, as if all\n",
      "things came unto one, and would fain be similes: ‘Here do all things\n",
      "come caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee, for they want to ride\n",
      "upon thy back. On every simile dost thou here ride to every truth. Here\n",
      "fly open unto thee all being’s words and word-cabinets; here all being\n",

      "In the autumn of 1883 my brother left the Engadine for Germany and\n",
      "stayed there a few weeks. In the following winter, after wandering\n",
      "somewhat erratically through Stresa, Genoa, and Spezia, he landed in\n",
      "Nice, where the climate so happily promoted his creative powers that\n",
      "he wrote the third part of “Zarathustra”. “In the winter, beneath the\n",
      "halcyon sky of Nice, which then looked down upon me for the first time\n",
      "in my life, I found the third ‘Zarathustra’—and came to the end of my\n",
      "task; the whole having occupied me scarcely a year. Many hidden corners\n",
      "and heights in the landscapes round about Nice are hallowed to me by\n",
      "unforgettable moments. That decisive chapter entitled ‘Old and New\n",
      "Tables’ was composed in the very difficult ascent from the station\n",
      "to Eza—that wonderful Moorish village in the rocks. My most creative\n",
      "moments were always accompanied by unusual muscular activity. The body\n",
      "is inspired: let us waive the question of the ‘soul.’ I might often have\n",
      "been seen dancing in those days. Without a suggestion of fatigue I could\n",

      "interruptions. The first notes relating to this part were written while\n",
      "he and I were staying together in Zurich in September 1884. In the\n",
      "following November, while staying at Mentone, he began to elaborate\n",
      "these notes, and after a long pause, finished the manuscript at Nice\n",
      "between the end of January and the middle of February 1885. My brother\n",
      "then called this part the fourth and last; but even before, and shortly\n",
      "after it had been privately printed, he wrote to me saying that he still\n",
      "intended writing a fifth and sixth part, and notes relating to these\n",
      "parts are now in my possession. This fourth part (the original MS. of\n",
      "which contains this note: “Only for my friends, not for the public”)\n",
      "is written in a particularly personal spirit, and those few to whom he\n",
      "presented a copy of it, he pledged to the strictest secrecy concerning\n",
      "its contents. He often thought of making this fourth part public also,\n",
      "but doubted whether he would ever be able to do so without considerably\n",
      "altering certain portions of it. At all events he resolved to distribute\n",
      "this manuscript production, of which only forty copies were printed,\n",
      "only among those who had proved themselves worthy of it, and it speaks\n",
      "eloquently of his utter loneliness and need of sympathy in those days,\n",

      "Already at the beginning of this history I hinted at the reasons which\n",

      "the majestic philosopher. His reasons, however, for choosing Zarathustra\n",
      "of all others to be his mouthpiece, he gives us in the following\n",
      "words:—“People have never asked me, as they should have done, what the\n",
      "name Zarathustra precisely means in my mouth, in the mouth of the first\n",
      "Immoralist; for what distinguishes that philosopher from all others\n",
      "in the past is the very fact that he was exactly the reverse of an\n",
      "immoralist. Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle between\n",
      "good and evil the essential wheel in the working of things. The\n",
      "translation of morality into the metaphysical, as force, cause, end in\n",
      "itself, was HIS work. But the very question suggests its own answer.\n",
      "Zarathustra CREATED the most portentous error, MORALITY, consequently he\n",
      "should also be the first to PERCEIVE that error, not only because he\n",
      "has had longer and greater experience of the subject than any other\n",
      "thinker—all history is the experimental refutation of the theory of\n",
      "the so-called moral order of things:—the more important point is that\n",
      "Zarathustra was more truthful than any other thinker. In his teaching\n",
      "alone do we meet with truthfulness upheld as the highest virtue—i.e.:\n",
      "the reverse of the COWARDICE of the ‘idealist’ who flees from reality.\n",
      "Zarathustra had more courage in his body than any other thinker before\n",
      "or after him. To tell the truth and TO AIM STRAIGHT: that is the first\n",
      "Persian virtue. Am I understood?... The overcoming of morality through\n",
      "itself—through truthfulness, the overcoming of the moralist through his\n",

      "When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of\n",

      "solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart\n",
      "changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the\n",
      "sun, and spake thus unto it:\n",
      "\n",
      "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for\n",
      "whom thou shinest!\n",
      "\n",
      "For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have\n",
      "wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine\n",
      "eagle, and my serpent.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and\n",
      "blessed thee for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much\n",
      "honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become\n",
      "joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the\n",
      "evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the\n",
      "nether-world, thou exuberant star!\n",
      "\n",
      "Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest\n",
      "happiness without envy!\n",
      "\n",

      "who had left his holy cot to seek roots. And thus spake the old man to\n",
      "Zarathustra:\n",
      "\n",
      "“No stranger to me is this wanderer: many years ago passed he by.\n",
      "Zarathustra he was called; but he hath altered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains: wilt thou now carry\n",
      "thy fire into the valleys? Fearest thou not the incendiary’s doom?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yea, I recognise Zarathustra. Pure is his eye, and no loathing lurketh\n",
      "about his mouth. Goeth he not along like a dancer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Altered is Zarathustra; a child hath Zarathustra become; an awakened one\n",
      "is Zarathustra: what wilt thou do in the land of the sleepers?\n",
      "\n",
      "As in the sea hast thou lived in solitude, and it hath borne thee up.\n",
      "Alas, wilt thou now go ashore? Alas, wilt thou again drag thy body\n",
      "thyself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Zarathustra answered: “I love mankind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why,” said the saint, “did I go into the forest and the desert? Was it\n",
      "not because I loved men far too well?\n",

      "Now I love God: men, I do not love. Man is a thing too imperfect for me.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Give them nothing,” said the saint. “Take rather part of their load,\n",
      "and carry it along with them—that will be most agreeable unto them: if\n",
      "only it be agreeable unto thee!\n",
      "\n",
      "If, however, thou wilt give unto them, give them no more than an alms,\n",
      "and let them also beg for it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” replied Zarathustra, “I give no alms. I am not poor enough for\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The saint laughed at Zarathustra, and spake thus: “Then see to it that\n",
      "they accept thy treasures! They are distrustful of anchorites, and do\n",
      "not believe that we come with gifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fall of our footsteps ringeth too hollow through their streets. And\n",
      "just as at night, when they are in bed and hear a man abroad long before\n",
      "sunrise, so they ask themselves concerning us: Where goeth the thief?\n",
      "\n",
      "Go not to men, but stay in the forest! Go rather to the animals! Why not\n",
      "be like me—a bear amongst bears, a bird amongst birds?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what doeth the saint in the forest?” asked Zarathustra.\n",
      "\n",
      "The saint answered: “I make hymns and sing them; and in making hymns I\n",
      "laugh and weep and mumble: thus do I praise God.\n",
      "\n",
      "With singing, weeping, laughing, and mumbling do I praise the God who is\n",
      "my God. But what dost thou bring us as a gift?”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Zarathustra had heard these words, he bowed to the saint and said:\n",
      "“What should I have to give thee! Let me rather hurry hence lest I take\n",
      "aught away from thee!”—And thus they parted from one another, the old\n",
      "man and Zarathustra, laughing like schoolboys.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: “Could it be\n",

      "GOD IS DEAD!”\n",
      "\n",
      "3.\n",

      "Too long, perhaps, have I lived in the mountains; too much have I\n",

      "\n",
      "Then, however, something happened which made every mouth mute and every\n",
      "eye fixed. In the meantime, of course, the rope-dancer had commenced his\n",
      "performance: he had come out at a little door, and was going along the\n",
      "rope which was stretched between two towers, so that it hung above the\n",
      "market-place and the people. When he was just midway across, the little\n",
      "door opened once more, and a gaudily-dressed fellow like a buffoon\n",
      "sprang out, and went rapidly after the first one. “Go on, halt-foot,”\n",
      " cried his frightful voice, “go on, lazy-bones, interloper,\n",
      "sallow-face!—lest I tickle thee with my heel! What dost thou here\n",
      "between the towers? In the tower is the place for thee, thou shouldst be\n",
      "locked up; to one better than thyself thou blockest the way!”—And with\n",
      "every word he came nearer and nearer the first one. When, however, he\n",
      "was but a step behind, there happened the frightful thing which made\n",
      "every mouth mute and every eye fixed—he uttered a yell like a devil,\n",
      "and jumped over the other who was in his way. The latter, however, when\n",
      "he thus saw his rival triumph, lost at the same time his head and his\n",
      "footing on the rope; he threw his pole away, and shot downwards faster\n",
      "than it, like an eddy of arms and legs, into the depth. The market-place\n",
      "and the people were like the sea when the storm cometh on: they all flew\n",
      "apart and in disorder, especially where the body was about to fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zarathustra, however, remained standing, and just beside him fell the\n",
      "body, badly injured and disfigured, but not yet dead. After a while\n",
      "consciousness returned to the shattered man, and he saw Zarathustra\n",
      "kneeling beside him. “What art thou doing there?” said he at last, “I\n",
      "knew long ago that the devil would trip me up. Now he draggeth me to\n",
      "hell: wilt thou prevent him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On mine honour, my friend,” answered Zarathustra, “there is nothing of\n",
      "all that whereof thou speakest: there is no devil and no hell. Thy soul\n",
      "will be dead even sooner than thy body: fear, therefore, nothing any\n",
      "more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man looked up distrustfully. “If thou speakest the truth,” said he,\n",
      "“I lose nothing when I lose my life. I am not much more than an animal\n",
      "which hath been taught to dance by blows and scanty fare.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” said Zarathustra, “thou hast made danger thy calling;\n",
      "therein there is nothing contemptible. Now thou perishest by thy\n",
      "calling: therefore will I bury thee with mine own hands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Zarathustra had said this the dying one did not reply further; but\n",
      "he moved his hand as if he sought the hand of Zarathustra in gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the evening came on, and the market-place veiled itself in\n",
      "gloom. Then the people dispersed, for even curiosity and terror become\n",
      "fatigued. Zarathustra, however, still sat beside the dead man on the\n",
      "ground, absorbed in thought: so he forgot the time. But at last it\n",
      "became night, and a cold wind blew upon the lonely one. Then arose\n",
      "Zarathustra and said to his heart:\n",
      "\n",
      "Verily, a fine catch of fish hath Zarathustra made to-day! It is not a\n",
      "man he hath caught, but a corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sombre is human life, and as yet without meaning: a buffoon may be\n",
      "fateful to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to teach men the sense of their existence, which is the Superman,\n",
      "the lightning out of the dark cloud—man.\n",
      "\n",
      "But still am I far from them, and my sense speaketh not unto their\n",
      "sense. To men I am still something between a fool and a corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloomy is the night, gloomy are the ways of Zarathustra. Come, thou cold\n",
      "and stiff companion! I carry thee to the place where I shall bury thee\n",
      "with mine own hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Zarathustra had said this to his heart, he put the corpse upon his\n",
      "shoulders and set out on his way. Yet had he not gone a hundred steps,\n",
      "when there stole a man up to him and whispered in his ear—and lo!\n",
      "he that spake was the buffoon from the tower. “Leave this town, O\n",
      "Zarathustra,” said he, “there are too many here who hate thee. The\n",
      "good and just hate thee, and call thee their enemy and despiser; the\n",
      "believers in the orthodox belief hate thee, and call thee a danger to\n",
      "the multitude. It was thy good fortune to be laughed at: and verily thou\n",
      "spakest like a buffoon. It was thy good fortune to associate with the\n",
      "dead dog; by so humiliating thyself thou hast saved thy life to-day.\n",
      "Depart, however, from this town,—or to-morrow I shall jump over thee,\n",
      "a living man over a dead one.” And when he had said this, the buffoon\n",
      "vanished; Zarathustra, however, went on through the dark streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the gate of the town the grave-diggers met him: they shone their\n",
      "torch on his face, and, recognising Zarathustra, they sorely derided\n",
      "him. “Zarathustra is carrying away the dead dog: a fine thing that\n",
      "Zarathustra hath turned a grave-digger! For our hands are too cleanly\n",
      "for that roast. Will Zarathustra steal the bite from the devil? Well\n",
      "then, good luck to the repast! If only the devil is not a better thief\n",
      "than Zarathustra!—he will steal them both, he will eat them both!” And\n",
      "they laughed among themselves, and put their heads together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zarathustra made no answer thereto, but went on his way. When he had\n",
      "gone on for two hours, past forests and swamps, he had heard too much of\n",
      "the hungry howling of the wolves, and he himself became a-hungry. So he\n",
      "halted at a lonely house in which a light was burning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hunger attacketh me,” said Zarathustra, “like a robber. Among forests\n",
      "and swamps my hunger attacketh me, and late in the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Strange humours hath my hunger. Often it cometh to me only after a\n",
      "repast, and all day it hath failed to come: where hath it been?”\n",
      "\n",
      "And thereupon Zarathustra knocked at the door of the house. An old man\n",
      "appeared, who carried a light, and asked: “Who cometh unto me and my bad\n",
      "sleep?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A living man and a dead one,” said Zarathustra. “Give me something to\n",
      "eat and drink, I forgot it during the day. He that feedeth the hungry\n",
      "refresheth his own soul, saith wisdom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man withdrew, but came back immediately and offered Zarathustra\n",
      "bread and wine. “A bad country for the hungry,” said he; “that is why\n",
      "I live here. Animal and man come unto me, the anchorite. But bid thy\n",
      "companion eat and drink also, he is wearier than thou.” Zarathustra\n",
      "answered: “My companion is dead; I shall hardly be able to persuade him\n",
      "to eat.” “That doth not concern me,” said the old man sullenly; “he\n",
      "that knocketh at my door must take what I offer him. Eat, and fare ye\n",
      "well!”—\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter Zarathustra again went on for two hours, trusting to the path\n",
      "and the light of the stars: for he was an experienced night-walker, and\n",

      "All values have already been created, and all created values—do I\n",

      "\n",
      "Respect and modesty in presence of sleep! That is the first thing! And\n",
      "to go out of the way of all who sleep badly and keep awake at night!\n",
      "\n",
      "Modest is even the thief in presence of sleep: he always stealeth softly\n",
      "through the night. Immodest, however, is the night-watchman; immodestly\n",
      "he carrieth his horn.\n",
      "\n",
      "No small art is it to sleep: it is necessary for that purpose to keep\n",
      "awake all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten times a day must thou overcome thyself: that causeth wholesome\n",
      "weariness, and is poppy to the soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten times must thou reconcile again with thyself; for overcoming is\n",
      "bitterness, and badly sleep the unreconciled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten truths must thou find during the day; otherwise wilt thou seek truth\n",
      "during the night, and thy soul will have been hungry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten times must thou laugh during the day, and be cheerful; otherwise thy\n",
      "stomach, the father of affliction, will disturb thee in the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few people know it, but one must have all the virtues in order to sleep\n",
      "well. Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit adultery?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shall I covet my neighbour’s maidservant? All that would ill accord with\n",
      "good sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "And even if one have all the virtues, there is still one thing needful:\n",
      "to send the virtues themselves to sleep at the right time.\n",
      "\n",
      "That they may not quarrel with one another, the good females! And about\n",
      "thee, thou unhappy one!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peace with God and thy neighbour: so desireth good sleep. And peace also\n",
      "with thy neighbour’s devil! Otherwise it will haunt thee in the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honour to the government, and obedience, and also to the crooked\n",

      "\n",

      "A small company is more welcome to me than a bad one: but they must come\n",

      "\n",
      "But I think of what I have done and thought during the day. Thus\n",
      "ruminating, patient as a cow, I ask myself: What were thy ten\n",
      "overcomings?\n",

      "\n",
      "Verily, on soft soles doth it come to me, the dearest of thieves, and\n",
      "stealeth from me my thoughts: stupid do I then stand, like this academic\n",
      "chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not much longer do I then stand: I already lie.—\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "A fool seemeth this wise man with his forty thoughts: but I believe he\n",
      "knoweth well how to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happy even is he who liveth near this wise man! Such sleep is\n",
      "contagious—even through a thick wall it is contagious.\n",
      "\n",
      "A magic resideth even in his academic chair. And not in vain did the\n",

      "desirablest nonsense for me also.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now know I well what people sought formerly above all else when they\n",

      "poppy-head virtues to promote it!\n",

      "Intoxicating joy is it for the sufferer to look away from his suffering\n",

      "madness, like all the Gods!\n",
      "\n",
      "A man was he, and only a poor fragment of a man and ego. Out of mine own\n",
      "ashes and glow it came unto me, that phantom. And verily, it came not\n",
      "unto me from the beyond!\n",
      "\n",
      "What happened, my brethren? I surpassed myself, the suffering one; I\n",

      "myself. And lo! Thereupon the phantom WITHDREW from me!\n",
      "\n",
      "To me the convalescent would it now be suffering and torment to believe\n",
      "in such phantoms: suffering would it now be to me, and humiliation. Thus\n",
      "speak I to backworldsmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suffering was it, and impotence—that created all backworlds; and\n",
      "the short madness of happiness, which only the greatest sufferer\n",
      "experienceth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weariness, which seeketh to get to the ultimate with one leap, with\n",
      "a death-leap; a poor ignorant weariness, unwilling even to will any\n",
      "longer: that created all Gods and backworlds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the body—it\n",
      "groped with the fingers of the infatuated spirit at the ultimate walls.\n",

      "Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the\n",
      "earth—it heard the bowels of existence speaking unto it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its head—and\n",
      "not with its head only—into “the other world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But that “other world” is well concealed from man, that dehumanised,\n",
      "inhuman world, which is a celestial naught; and the bowels of existence\n",
      "do not speak unto man, except as man.\n",

      "\n",
      "And this most upright existence, the ego—it speaketh of the body, and\n",

      "with broken wings.\n",
      "\n",

      "recognise the eyes of Zarathustra, wriggled awkwardly, and tried to get\n",
      "away. “Not at all,” said Zarathustra, “as yet hast thou not received\n",
      "my thanks! Thou hast awakened me in time; my journey is yet long.”\n",
      " “Thy journey is short,” said the adder sadly; “my poison is fatal.”\n",

      "his wound.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Zarathustra once told this to his disciples they asked him:\n",
      "“And what, O Zarathustra, is the moral of thy story?” And Zarathustra\n",

      "When Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was\n",

      "people who called themselves his disciples, and kept him company. Thus\n",

      "hath scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient and full of\n",

      "\n",

      "But what did Zarathustra once say unto thee? That the poets lie too\n",

      "Believest thou that he there spake the truth? Why dost thou believe it?”\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "There is an isle in the sea—not far from the Happy Isles of\n",
      "Zarathustra—on which a volcano ever smoketh; of which isle the people,\n",
      "and especially the old women amongst them, say that it is placed as a\n",
      "rock before the gate of the nether-world; but that through the volcano\n",
      "itself the narrow way leadeth downwards which conducteth to this gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now about the time that Zarathustra sojourned on the Happy Isles, it\n",
      "happened that a ship anchored at the isle on which standeth the smoking\n",
      "mountain, and the crew went ashore to shoot rabbits. About the noontide\n",
      "hour, however, when the captain and his men were together again, they\n",
      "saw suddenly a man coming towards them through the air, and a voice said\n",
      "distinctly: “It is time! It is the highest time!” But when the figure\n",
      "was nearest to them (it flew past quickly, however, like a shadow, in\n",
      "the direction of the volcano), then did they recognise with the greatest\n",
      "surprise that it was Zarathustra; for they had all seen him before\n",
      "except the captain himself, and they loved him as the people love: in\n",
      "such wise that love and awe were combined in equal degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Behold!” said the old helmsman, “there goeth Zarathustra to hell!”\n",
      "\n",
      "About the same time that these sailors landed on the fire-isle, there\n",
      "was a rumour that Zarathustra had disappeared; and when his friends were\n",
      "asked about it, they said that he had gone on board a ship by night,\n",
      "without saying whither he was going.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus there arose some uneasiness. After three days, however, there came\n",
      "the story of the ship’s crew in addition to this uneasiness—and\n",
      "then did all the people say that the devil had taken Zarathustra. His\n",
      "disciples laughed, sure enough, at this talk; and one of them said even:\n",
      "“Sooner would I believe that Zarathustra hath taken the devil.” But at\n",
      "the bottom of their hearts they were all full of anxiety and longing: so\n",
      "their joy was great when on the fifth day Zarathustra appeared amongst\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is the account of Zarathustra’s interview with the fire-dog:\n",
      "\n",
      "The earth, said he, hath a skin; and this skin hath diseases. One of\n",
      "these diseases, for example, is called “man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And another of these diseases is called “the fire-dog”: concerning HIM\n",
      "men have greatly deceived themselves, and let themselves be deceived.\n",

      "him who hath too much behind, couldst thou well, also, take away a\n",

      "upon him the greatest injury; for hardly can he run, when his vices\n",
      "run away with him—so do the people teach concerning cripples. And why\n",

      "\n",

      "immense ear was perched on a small thin stalk—the stalk, however, was a\n",
      "man! A person putting a glass to his eyes, could even recognise further\n",
      "a small envious countenance, and also that a bloated soullet dangled at\n",
      "the stalk. The people told me, however, that the big ear was not only a\n",
      "man, but a great man, a genius. But I never believed in the people when\n",

      "And when he hastily looked around and stood up, behold, there stood the\n",

      "distress and affliction: they will soon raise thy bark also and carry\n",
      "thee away.”—Thereupon was Zarathustra silent and wondered.—“Dost thou\n",
      "still hear nothing?” continued the soothsayer: “doth it not rush and\n",
      "roar out of the depth?”—Zarathustra was silent once more and listened:\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "covered with perspiration.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "curses and twenty bad invectives, so that in his fright he raised his\n",
      "stick and also struck the trodden one. Immediately afterwards, however,\n",
      "he regained his composure, and his heart laughed at the folly he had\n",
      "just committed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me,” said he to the trodden one, who had got up enraged, and had\n",

      "Lo! am I then a dog?”—And thereupon the sitting one got up, and pulled\n",
      "his naked arm out of the swamp. For at first he had lain outstretched\n",

      "already methinketh pure clear day is dawning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE,” answered he who was asked,\n",

      "Better know nothing than half-know many things! Better be a fool on\n",

      "slowly, and at last stood still. Then, however, when he opened his eyes,\n",
      "he saw something sitting by the wayside shaped like a man, and hardly\n",
      "like a man, something nondescript. And all at once there came over\n",
      "Zarathustra a great shame, because he had gazed on such a thing.\n",
      "Blushing up to the very roots of his white hair, he turned aside his\n",

      "LXVIII. THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When Zarathustra had left the ugliest man, he was chilled and felt\n",
      "lonesome: for much coldness and lonesomeness came over his spirit, so\n",
      "that even his limbs became colder thereby. When, however, he wandered\n",
      "on and on, uphill and down, at times past green meadows, though also\n",
      "sometimes over wild stony couches where formerly perhaps an impatient\n",
      "brook had made its bed, then he turned all at once warmer and heartier\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What hath happened unto me?” he asked himself, “something warm and\n",
      "living quickeneth me; it must be in the neighbourhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already am I less alone; unconscious companions and brethren rove around\n",
      "me; their warm breath toucheth my soul.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When, however, he spied about and sought for the comforters of his\n",
      "lonesomeness, behold, there were kine there standing together on an\n",
      "eminence, whose proximity and smell had warmed his heart. The kine,\n",
      "however, seemed to listen eagerly to a speaker, and took no heed of him\n",
      "who approached. When, however, Zarathustra was quite nigh unto them,\n",
      "then did he hear plainly that a human voice spake in the midst of the\n",
      "kine, and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the\n",
      "speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then ran Zarathustra up speedily and drove the animals aside; for he\n",
      "feared that some one had here met with harm, which the pity of the\n",
      "kine would hardly be able to relieve. But in this he was deceived; for\n",
      "behold, there sat a man on the ground who seemed to be persuading\n",
      "the animals to have no fear of him, a peaceable man and\n",
      "Preacher-on-the-Mount, out of whose eyes kindness itself preached. “What\n",
      "dost thou seek here?” called out Zarathustra in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do I here seek?” answered he: “the same that thou seekest, thou\n",
      "mischief-maker; that is to say, happiness upon earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "To that end, however, I would fain learn of these kine. For I tell thee\n",
      "that I have already talked half a morning unto them, and just now were\n",
      "they about to give me their answer. Why dost thou disturb them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Except we be converted and become as kine, we shall in no wise enter\n",
      "into the kingdom of heaven. For we ought to learn from them one thing:\n",
      "ruminating.\n",
      "\n",
      "And verily, although a man should gain the whole world, and yet not\n",
      "learn one thing, ruminating, what would it profit him! He would not be\n",
      "rid of his affliction,\n",
      "\n",
      "—His great affliction: that, however, is at present called DISGUST. Who\n",
      "hath not at present his heart, his mouth and his eyes full of disgust?\n",
      "Thou also! Thou also! But behold these kine!”—\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus spake the Preacher-on-the-Mount, and turned then his own look\n",
      "towards Zarathustra—for hitherto it had rested lovingly on the kine—:\n",
      "then, however, he put on a different expression. “Who is this with whom\n",
      "I talk?” he exclaimed frightened, and sprang up from the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the man without disgust, this is Zarathustra himself, the\n",
      "surmounter of the great disgust, this is the eye, this is the mouth,\n",
      "this is the heart of Zarathustra himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And whilst he thus spake he kissed with o’erflowing eyes the hands\n",
      "of him with whom he spake, and behaved altogether like one to whom a\n",
      "precious gift and jewel hath fallen unawares from heaven. The kine,\n",
      "however, gazed at it all and wondered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak not of me, thou strange one; thou amiable one!” said Zarathustra,\n",
      "and restrained his affection, “speak to me firstly of thyself! Art thou\n",
      "not the voluntary beggar who once cast away great riches,—\n",
      "\n",
      "—Who was ashamed of his riches and of the rich, and fled to the poorest\n",
      "to bestow upon them his abundance and his heart? But they received him\n",
      "not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But they received me not,” said the voluntary beggar, “thou knowest it,\n",
      "forsooth. So I went at last to the animals and to those kine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then learnedst thou,” interrupted Zarathustra, “how much harder it is\n",
      "to give properly than to take properly, and that bestowing well is an\n",
      "ART—the last, subtlest master-art of kindness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Especially nowadays,” answered the voluntary beggar: “at present, that\n",
      "is to say, when everything low hath become rebellious and exclusive and\n",
      "haughty in its manner—in the manner of the populace.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the hour hath come, thou knowest it forsooth, for the great, evil,\n",
      "long, slow mob-and-slave-insurrection: it extendeth and extendeth!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now doth it provoke the lower classes, all benevolence and petty giving;\n",
      "and the over-rich may be on their guard!\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoever at present drip, like bulgy bottles out of all-too-small\n",
      "necks:—of such bottles at present one willingly breaketh the necks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wanton avidity, bilious envy, careworn revenge, populace-pride: all\n",
      "these struck mine eye. It is no longer true that the poor are blessed.\n",
      "The kingdom of heaven, however, is with the kine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And why is it not with the rich?” asked Zarathustra temptingly, while\n",
      "he kept back the kine which sniffed familiarly at the peaceful one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why dost thou tempt me?” answered the other. “Thou knowest it thyself\n",
      "better even than I. What was it drove me to the poorest, O Zarathustra?\n",
      "Was it not my disgust at the richest?\n",
      "\n",
      "—At the culprits of riches, with cold eyes and rank thoughts, who pick\n",
      "up profit out of all kinds of rubbish—at this rabble that stinketh to\n",
      "heaven,\n",
      "\n",
      "—At this gilded, falsified populace, whose fathers were pickpockets,\n",
      "or carrion-crows, or rag-pickers, with wives compliant, lewd and\n",
      "forgetful:—for they are all of them not far different from harlots—\n",
      "\n",
      "Populace above, populace below! What are ‘poor’ and ‘rich’ at present!\n",
      "That distinction did I unlearn,—then did I flee away further and ever\n",
      "further, until I came to those kine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus spake the peaceful one, and puffed himself and perspired with\n",
      "his words: so that the kine wondered anew. Zarathustra, however, kept\n",
      "looking into his face with a smile, all the time the man talked so\n",
      "severely—and shook silently his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou doest violence to thyself, thou Preacher-on-the-Mount, when thou\n",

      "\n",
      "Nor, methinketh, hath thy stomach either: unto IT all such rage and\n",
      "hatred and foaming-over is repugnant. Thy stomach wanteth softer things:\n",
      "thou art not a butcher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather seemest thou to me a plant-eater and a root-man. Perhaps thou\n",
      "grindest corn. Certainly, however, thou art averse to fleshly joys, and\n",
      "thou lovest honey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou hast divined me well,” answered the voluntary beggar, with\n",

      "what tasteth sweetly and maketh pure breath:\n",
      "\n",
      "—Also what requireth a long time, a day’s-work and a mouth’s-work for\n",
      "gentle idlers and sluggards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthest, to be sure, have those kine carried it: they have devised\n",
      "ruminating and lying in the sun. They also abstain from all heavy\n",
      "thoughts which inflate the heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "—“Well!” said Zarathustra, “thou shouldst also see MINE animals, mine\n",
      "eagle and my serpent,—their like do not at present exist on earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behold, thither leadeth the way to my cave: be to-night its guest. And\n",
      "talk to mine animals of the happiness of animals,—\n",
      "\n",
      "—Until I myself come home. For now a cry of distress calleth me hastily\n",
      "away from thee. Also, shouldst thou find new honey with me, ice-cold,\n",
      "golden-comb-honey, eat it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, however, take leave at once of thy kine, thou strange one! thou\n",

      "\n",
      "“Away, away with thee! thou evil flatterer!” cried Zarathustra\n",

      "myself, thy shadow!” But Zarathustra did not wait; for a sudden\n",

      "shadow and follower to the ground, so closely had the latter followed at\n",
      "his heels, and so weak was he. For when Zarathustra scrutinised him\n",
      "with his glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition, so slender,\n",
      "swarthy, hollow and worn-out did this follower appear.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Forgive me,” answered the shadow, “that it is I; and if I please thee\n",

      "\n",
      "A wanderer am I, who have walked long at thy heels; always on the way,\n",
      "but without a goal, also without a home: so that verily, I lack little\n",

      "not a Jew.\n",
      "\n",
      "What? Must I ever be on the way? Whirled by every wind, unsettled,\n",
      "driven about? O earth, thou hast become too round for me!\n",
      "\n",
      "On every surface have I already sat, like tired dust have I fallen\n",
      "asleep on mirrors and window-panes: everything taketh from me, nothing\n",

      "\n",
      "With thee have I wandered about in the remotest, coldest worlds, like a\n",
      "phantom that voluntarily haunteth winter roofs and snows.\n",
      "\n",
      "With thee have I pushed into all the forbidden, all the worst and the\n",
      "furthest: and if there be anything of virtue in me, it is that I have\n",

      "\n",
      "With thee have I broken up whatever my heart revered; all\n",

      "\n",
      "Ah, where have gone all my goodness and all my shame and all my belief\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "—And Zarathustra ran and ran, but he found no one else, and was alone\n",
      "and ever found himself again; he enjoyed and quaffed his solitude, and\n",
      "thought of good things—for hours. About the hour of noontide, however,\n",
      "when the sun stood exactly over Zarathustra’s head, he passed an old,\n",
      "bent and gnarled tree, which was encircled round by the ardent love of\n",
      "a vine, and hidden from itself; from this there hung yellow grapes in\n",
      "abundance, confronting the wanderer. Then he felt inclined to quench a\n",
      "little thirst, and to break off for himself a cluster of grapes. When,\n",
      "however, he had already his arm outstretched for that purpose, he felt\n",
      "still more inclined for something else—namely, to lie down beside the\n",
      "tree at the hour of perfect noontide and sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Zarathustra did; and no sooner had he laid himself on the ground in\n",
      "the stillness and secrecy of the variegated grass, than he had forgotten\n",
      "his little thirst, and fell asleep. For as the proverb of Zarathustra\n",
      "saith: “One thing is more necessary than the other.” Only that his eyes\n",
      "remained open:—for they never grew weary of viewing and admiring the\n",
      "tree and the love of the vine. In falling asleep, however, Zarathustra\n",
      "spake thus to his heart:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush! Hush! Hath not the world now become perfect? What hath happened\n",
      "unto me?\n",

      "\n",
      "—How long and weary it becometh, my strange soul! Hath a seventh-day\n",
      "evening come to it precisely at noontide? Hath it already wandered too\n",
      "long, blissfully, among good and ripe things?\n",
      "\n",
      "It stretcheth itself out, long—longer! it lieth still, my strange\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Who art thou then, O my soul!” (and here he became frightened, for a\n",
      "sunbeam shot down from heaven upon his face.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“O heaven above me,” said he sighing, and sat upright, “thou gazest at\n",

      "wilt thou drink my soul back into thee?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra, and rose from his couch beside the tree, as if\n",
      "awakening from a strange drunkenness: and behold! there stood the\n",
      "sun still exactly above his head. One might, however, rightly infer\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was late in the afternoon only when Zarathustra, after long useless\n",
      "searching and strolling about, again came home to his cave. When,\n",
      "however, he stood over against it, not more than twenty paces therefrom,\n",
      "the thing happened which he now least of all expected: he heard anew the\n",
      "great CRY OF DISTRESS. And extraordinary! this time the cry came out\n",
      "of his own cave. It was a long, manifold, peculiar cry, and Zarathustra\n",
      "plainly distinguished that it was composed of many voices: although\n",
      "heard at a distance it might sound like the cry out of a single mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon Zarathustra rushed forward to his cave, and behold! what a\n",
      "spectacle awaited him after that concert! For there did they all sit\n",
      "together whom he had passed during the day: the king on the right and\n",
      "the king on the left, the old magician, the pope, the voluntary\n",
      "beggar, the shadow, the intellectually conscientious one, the sorrowful\n",
      "soothsayer, and the ass; the ugliest man, however, had set a crown on\n",
      "his head, and had put round him two purple girdles,—for he liked, like\n",
      "all ugly ones, to disguise himself and play the handsome person. In the\n",
      "midst, however, of that sorrowful company stood Zarathustra’s eagle,\n",
      "ruffled and disquieted, for it had been called upon to answer too much\n",
      "for which its pride had not any answer; the wise serpent however hung\n",
      "round its neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this did Zarathustra behold with great astonishment; then however he\n",
      "scrutinised each individual guest with courteous curiosity, read their\n",
      "souls and wondered anew. In the meantime the assembled ones had risen\n",
      "from their seats, and waited with reverence for Zarathustra to speak.\n",
      "Zarathustra however spake thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ye despairing ones! Ye strange ones! So it was YOUR cry of distress\n",
      "that I heard? And now do I know also where he is to be sought, whom I\n",
      "have sought for in vain to-day: THE HIGHER MAN—:\n",
      "\n",
      "—In mine own cave sitteth he, the higher man! But why do I wonder! Have\n",
      "not I myself allured him to me by honey-offerings and artful lure-calls\n",
      "of my happiness?\n",
      "\n",
      "But it seemeth to me that ye are badly adapted for company: ye make\n",
      "one another’s hearts fretful, ye that cry for help, when ye sit here\n",
      "together? There is one that must first come,\n",
      "\n",
      "—One who will make you laugh once more, a good jovial buffoon, a\n",
      "dancer, a wind, a wild romp, some old fool:—what think ye?\n",
      "\n",
      "Forgive me, however, ye despairing ones, for speaking such trivial words\n",
      "before you, unworthy, verily, of such guests! But ye do not divine WHAT\n",
      "maketh my heart wanton:—\n",
      "\n",
      "—Ye yourselves do it, and your aspect, forgive it me! For every one\n",
      "becometh courageous who beholdeth a despairing one. To encourage a\n",
      "despairing one—every one thinketh himself strong enough to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "To myself have ye given this power,—a good gift, mine honourable\n",
      "guests! An excellent guest’s-present! Well, do not then upbraid when I\n",
      "also offer you something of mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is mine empire and my dominion: that which is mine, however, shall\n",
      "this evening and to-night be yours. Mine animals shall serve you: let my\n",
      "cave be your resting-place!\n",
      "\n",
      "At house and home with me shall no one despair: in my purlieus do I\n",

      "then take the whole hand also, yea, and the heart with it! Welcome here,\n",
      "welcome to you, my guests!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra, and laughed with love and mischief. After this\n",
      "greeting his guests bowed once more and were reverentially silent; the\n",
      "king on the right, however, answered him in their name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Zarathustra, by the way in which thou hast given us thy hand and thy\n",
      "greeting, we recognise thee as Zarathustra. Thou hast humbled thyself\n",
      "before us; almost hast thou hurt our reverence—:\n",
      "\n",
      "—Who however could have humbled himself as thou hast done, with such\n",
      "pride? THAT uplifteth us ourselves; a refreshment is it, to our eyes and\n",
      "hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "To behold this, merely, gladly would we ascend higher mountains than\n",
      "this. For as eager beholders have we come; we wanted to see what\n",
      "brighteneth dim eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And lo! now is it all over with our cries of distress. Now are our minds\n",

      "become wanton.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing, O Zarathustra, that groweth more pleasingly on earth\n",
      "than a lofty, strong will: it is the finest growth. An entire landscape\n",
      "refresheth itself at one such tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the pine do I compare him, O Zarathustra, which groweth up like\n",

      "stately,—\n",
      "\n",
      "—In the end, however, grasping out for ITS dominion with strong, green\n",
      "branches, asking weighty questions of the wind, the storm, and whatever\n",

      "hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "And verily, towards thy mountain and thy tree do many eyes turn to-day;\n",
      "a great longing hath arisen, and many have learned to ask: ‘Who is\n",

      "\n",
      "And those into whose ears thou hast at any time dripped thy song and thy\n",
      "honey: all the hidden ones, the lone-dwellers and the twain-dwellers,\n",
      "have simultaneously said to their hearts:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Doth Zarathustra still live? It is no longer worth while to live,\n",

      "Now doth it come to pass that solitude itself becometh fragile and\n",

      "\n",
      "Now do the waves rise and rise around thy mountain, O Zarathustra. And\n",

      "\n",
      "And that we despairing ones have now come into thy cave, and already no\n",
      "longer despair:—it is but a prognostic and a presage that better ones\n",
      "are on the way to thee,—\n",
      "\n",
      "—For they themselves are on the way to thee, the last remnant of\n",

      "back frightened, fleeing as it were, silently and suddenly into the far\n",
      "distance. After a little while, however, he was again at home with his\n",
      "guests, looked at them with clear scrutinising eyes, and said:\n",
      "\n",

      "up to Zarathustra, thanking, honouring, caressing him, and kissing his\n",
      "hands, each in his own peculiar way; so that some laughed and some wept.\n",
      "The old soothsayer, however, danced with delight; and though he was\n",

      "still fuller of sweet life, and had renounced all weariness. There are\n",
      "even those who narrate that the ass then danced: for not in vain had the\n",
      "ugliest man previously given it wine to drink. That may be the case, or\n",
      "it may be otherwise; and if in truth the ass did not dance that evening,\n",

      "\n",
      "—This had Zarathustra spoken to his heart when the sun arose: then\n",
      "looked he inquiringly aloft, for he heard above him the sharp call of\n",
      "his eagle. “Well!” called he upwards, “thus is it pleasing and proper to\n",
      "me. Mine animals are awake, for I am awake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mine eagle is awake, and like me honoureth the sun. With eagle-talons\n",

      "But still do I lack my proper men!”—\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra; then, however, it happened that all on a sudden\n",
      "he became aware that he was flocked around and fluttered around, as if\n",
      "by innumerable birds,—the whizzing of so many wings, however, and the\n",
      "crowding around his head was so great that he shut his eyes. And verily,\n",
      "there came down upon him as it were a cloud, like a cloud of arrows\n",
      "which poureth upon a new enemy. But behold, here it was a cloud of love,\n",
      "and showered upon a new friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What happeneth unto me?” thought Zarathustra in his astonished heart,\n",
      "and slowly seated himself on the big stone which lay close to the exit\n",
      "from his cave. But while he grasped about with his hands, around him,\n",
      "above him and below him, and repelled the tender birds, behold, there\n",
      "then happened to him something still stranger: for he grasped thereby\n",
      "unawares into a mass of thick, warm, shaggy hair; at the same time,\n",
      "however, there sounded before him a roar,—a long, soft lion-roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“THE SIGN COMETH,” said Zarathustra, and a change came over his heart.\n",
      "And in truth, when it turned clear before him, there lay a yellow,\n",
      "powerful animal at his feet, resting its head on his knee,—unwilling to\n",
      "leave him out of love, and doing like a dog which again findeth its old\n",
      "master. The doves, however, were no less eager with their love than the\n",
      "lion; and whenever a dove whisked over its nose, the lion shook its head\n",
      "and wondered and laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all this went on Zarathustra spake only a word: “MY CHILDREN ARE\n",
      "NIGH, MY CHILDREN”—, then he became quite mute. His heart, however,\n",
      "was loosed, and from his eyes there dropped down tears and fell upon\n",
      "his hands. And he took no further notice of anything, but sat there\n",
      "motionless, without repelling the animals further. Then flew the doves\n",
      "to and fro, and perched on his shoulder, and caressed his white hair,\n",
      "and did not tire of their tenderness and joyousness. The strong lion,\n",
      "however, licked always the tears that fell on Zarathustra’s hands, and\n",
      "roared and growled shyly. Thus did these animals do.—\n",
      "\n",
      "All this went on for a long time, or a short time: for properly\n",
      "speaking, there is NO time on earth for such things—. Meanwhile,\n",
      "however, the higher men had awakened in Zarathustra’s cave, and\n",
      "marshalled themselves for a procession to go to meet Zarathustra, and\n",
      "give him their morning greeting: for they had found when they awakened\n",
      "that he no longer tarried with them. When, however, they reached the\n",
      "door of the cave and the noise of their steps had preceded them, the\n",
      "lion started violently; it turned away all at once from Zarathustra, and\n",
      "roaring wildly, sprang towards the cave. The higher men, however, when\n",
      "they heard the lion roaring, cried all aloud as with one voice, fled\n",
      "back and vanished in an instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zarathustra himself, however, stunned and strange, rose from his seat,\n",
      "looked around him, stood there astonished, inquired of his heart,\n",
      "bethought himself, and remained alone. “What did I hear?” said he at\n",
      "last, slowly, “what happened unto me just now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon there came to him his recollection, and he took in at a glance\n",
      "all that had taken place between yesterday and to-day. “Here is indeed\n",
      "the stone,” said he, and stroked his beard, “on IT sat I yester-morn;\n",
      "and here came the soothsayer unto me, and here heard I first the cry\n",
      "which I heard just now, the great cry of distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "O ye higher men, YOUR distress was it that the old soothsayer foretold\n",
      "to me yester-morn,—\n",
      "\n",
      "—Unto your distress did he want to seduce and tempt me: ‘O\n",
      "Zarathustra,’ said he to me, ‘I come to seduce thee to thy last sin.’\n",
      "\n",
      "To my last sin?” cried Zarathustra, and laughed angrily at his own\n",
      "words: “WHAT hath been reserved for me as my last sin?”\n",
      "\n",
      "—And once more Zarathustra became absorbed in himself, and sat down\n",
      "again on the big stone and meditated. Suddenly he sprang up,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“FELLOW-SUFFERING! FELLOW-SUFFERING WITH THE HIGHER MEN!” he cried out,\n",
      "and his countenance changed into brass. “Well! THAT—hath had its time!\n",
      "\n",
      "My suffering and my fellow-suffering—what matter about them! Do I then\n",
      "strive after HAPPINESS? I strive after my WORK!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well! The lion hath come, my children are nigh, Zarathustra hath grown\n",

      "This is MY morning, MY day beginneth: ARISE NOW, ARISE, THOU GREAT\n",
      "NOONTIDE!”—\n",

      "NOTES ON “THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA” BY ANTHONY M. LUDOVICI.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had some opportunities of studying the conditions under which\n",
      "Nietzsche is read in Germany, France, and England, and I have found\n",
      "that, in each of these countries, students of his philosophy, as if\n",
      "actuated by precisely similar motives and desires, and misled by the\n",
      "same mistaken tactics on the part of most publishers, all proceed in the\n",
      "same happy-go-lucky style when “taking him up.” They have had it said to\n",
      "them that he wrote without any system, and they very naturally conclude\n",
      "that it does not matter in the least whether they begin with his first,\n",
      "third, or last book, provided they can obtain a few vague ideas as to\n",
      "what his leading and most sensational principles were.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it is clear that the book with the most mysterious, startling, or\n",
      "suggestive title, will always stand the best chance of being purchased\n",
      "by those who have no other criteria to guide them in their choice\n",
      "than the aspect of a title-page; and this explains why “Thus Spake\n",
      "Zarathustra” is almost always the first and often the only one of\n",
      "Nietzsche’s books that falls into the hands of the uninitiated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The title suggests all kinds of mysteries; a glance at the\n",
      "chapter-headings quickly confirms the suspicions already aroused,\n",
      "and the sub-title: “A Book for All and None”, generally succeeds in\n",
      "dissipating the last doubts the prospective purchaser may entertain\n",
      "concerning his fitness for the book or its fitness for him. And what\n",
      "happens?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thus Spake Zarathustra” is taken home; the reader, who perchance may\n",
      "know no more concerning Nietzsche than a magazine article has told him,\n",
      "tries to read it and, understanding less than half he reads, probably\n",
      "never gets further than the second or third part,—and then only to feel\n",
      "convinced that Nietzsche himself was “rather hazy” as to what he was\n",
      "talking about. Such chapters as “The Child with the Mirror”, “In the\n",
      "Happy Isles”, “The Grave-Song,” “Immaculate Perception,” “The Stillest\n",
      "Hour”, “The Seven Seals”, and many others, are almost utterly devoid of\n",
      "meaning to all those who do not know something of Nietzsche’s life, his\n",
      "aims and his friendships.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of fact, “Thus Spake Zarathustra”, though it is\n",
      "unquestionably Nietzsche’s opus magnum, is by no means the first of\n",
      "Nietzsche’s works that the beginner ought to undertake to read. The\n",
      "author himself refers to it as the deepest work ever offered to the\n",
      "German public, and elsewhere speaks of his other writings as being\n",
      "necessary for the understanding of it. But when it is remembered that\n",
      "in Zarathustra we not only have the history of his most intimate\n",
      "experiences, friendships, feuds, disappointments, triumphs and the like,\n",
      "but that the very form in which they are narrated is one which tends\n",
      "rather to obscure than to throw light upon them, the difficulties which\n",
      "meet the reader who starts quite unprepared will be seen to be really\n",
      "formidable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zarathustra, then,—this shadowy, allegorical personality, speaking in\n",
      "allegories and parables, and at times not even refraining from relating\n",
      "his own dreams—is a figure we can understand but very imperfectly if we\n",
      "have no knowledge of his creator and counterpart, Friedrich Nietzsche;\n",
      "and it were therefore well, previous to our study of the more abstruse\n",
      "parts of this book, if we were to turn to some authoritative book on\n",
      "Nietzsche’s life and works and to read all that is there said on the\n",
      "subject. Those who can read German will find an excellent guide, in this\n",
      "respect, in Frau Foerster-Nietzsche’s exhaustive and highly interesting\n",
      "biography of her brother: “Das Leben Friedrich Nietzsche’s” (published\n",
      "by Naumann); while the works of Deussen, Raoul Richter, and Baroness\n",
      "Isabelle von Unger-Sternberg, will be found to throw useful and\n",
      "necessary light upon many questions which it would be difficult for a\n",
      "sister to touch upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "In regard to the actual philosophical views expounded in this work,\n",
      "there is an excellent way of clearing up any difficulties they may\n",
      "present, and that is by an appeal to Nietzsche’s other works. Again and\n",
      "again, of course, he will be found to express himself so clearly that\n",
      "all reference to his other writings may be dispensed with; but where\n",
      "this is not the case, the advice he himself gives is after all the best\n",
      "to be followed here, viz.:—to regard such works as: “Joyful Science”,\n",
      "“Beyond Good and Evil”, “The Genealogy of Morals”, “The Twilight of\n",
      "the Idols”, “The Antichrist”, “The Will to Power”, etc., etc., as the\n",
      "necessary preparation for “Thus Spake Zarathustra”.\n",
      "\n",
      "These directions, though they are by no means simple to carry out, seem\n",
      "at least to possess the quality of definiteness and straightforwardness.\n",
      "“Follow them and all will be clear,” I seem to imply. But I regret to\n",
      "say that this is not really the case. For my experience tells me that\n",
      "even after the above directions have been followed with the greatest\n",
      "possible zeal, the student will still halt in perplexity before certain\n",
      "passages in the book before us, and wonder what they mean. Now, it is\n",
      "with the view of giving a little additional help to all those who find\n",
      "themselves in this position that I proceed to put forth my own personal\n",
      "interpretation of the more abstruse passages in this work.\n",
      "\n",
      "In offering this little commentary to the Nietzsche student, I should\n",
      "like it to be understood that I make no claim as to its infallibility or\n",
      "indispensability. It represents but an attempt on my part—a very feeble\n",
      "one perhaps—to give the reader what little help I can in surmounting\n",
      "difficulties which a long study of Nietzsche’s life and works has\n",
      "enabled me, partially I hope, to overcome.\n",
      "\n",
      " ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it would be as well to start out with a broad and rapid sketch\n",
      "of Nietzsche as a writer on Morals, Evolution, and Sociology, so that\n",
      "the reader may be prepared to pick out for himself, so to speak, all\n",
      "passages in this work bearing in any way upon Nietzsche’s views in those\n",
      "three important branches of knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "(A.) Nietzsche and Morality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In morality, Nietzsche starts out by adopting the position of the\n",
      "relativist. He says there are no absolute values “good” and “evil”;\n",
      "these are mere means adopted by all in order to acquire power to\n",
      "maintain their place in the world, or to become supreme. It is the\n",
      "lion’s good to devour an antelope. It is the dead-leaf butterfly’s\n",
      "good to tell a foe a falsehood. For when the dead-leaf butterfly is in\n",
      "danger, it clings to the side of a twig, and what it says to its foe is\n",
      "practically this: “I am not a butterfly, I am a dead leaf, and can be\n",
      "of no use to thee.” This is a lie which is good to the butterfly, for\n",
      "it preserves it. In nature every species of organic being instinctively\n",
      "adopts and practises those acts which most conduce to the prevalence\n",
      "or supremacy of its kind. Once the most favourable order of conduct is\n",
      "found, proved efficient and established, it becomes the ruling morality\n",
      "of the species that adopts it and bears them along to victory. All\n",

      "on the one side, and the impotent, the mean, the weak, and the\n",

      "\n",
      "Where attempts have not been made to reconcile the two moralities, they\n",
      "may be described as follows:—All is GOOD in the noble morality which\n",
      "proceeds from strength, power, health, well-constitutedness, happiness,\n",
      "and awfulness; for, the motive force behind the people practising it is\n",
      "“the struggle for power.” The antithesis “good and bad” to this\n",
      "first class means the same as “noble” and “despicable.” “Bad” in the\n",
      "master-morality must be applied to the coward, to all acts that spring\n",
      "from weakness, to the man with “an eye to the main chance,” who would\n",
      "forsake everything in order to live.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the second, the slave-morality, the case is different. There,\n",
      "inasmuch as the community is an oppressed, suffering, unemancipated, and\n",
      "weary one, all THAT will be held to be good which alleviates the\n",
      "state of suffering. Pity, the obliging hand, the warm heart, patience,\n",
      "industry, and humility—these are unquestionably the qualities we shall\n",
      "here find flooded with the light of approval and admiration; because\n",
      "they are the most USEFUL qualities—; they make life endurable, they are\n",
      "of assistance in the “struggle for existence” which is the motive force\n",
      "behind the people practising this morality. To this class, all that is\n",
      "AWFUL is bad, in fact it is THE evil par excellence. Strength, health,\n",
      "superabundance of animal spirits and power, are regarded with hate,\n",
      "suspicion, and fear by the subordinate class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Nietzsche believed that the first or the noble-morality conduced to\n",
      "an ascent in the line of life; because it was creative and active. On\n",
      "the other hand, he believed that the second or slave-morality, where\n",
      "it became paramount, led to degeneration, because it was passive and\n",
      "defensive, wanting merely to keep those who practised it alive. Hence\n",
      "his earnest advocacy of noble-morality.\n",

      "(C.) Nietzsche and Evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nietzsche as an evolutionist I shall have occasion to define and discuss\n",
      "in the course of these notes (see Notes on Chapter LVI., par. 10, and on\n",
      "Chapter LVII.). For the present let it suffice for us to know that he\n",
      "accepted the “Development Hypothesis” as an explanation of the origin of\n",
      "species: but he did not halt where most naturalists have halted. He\n",
      "by no means regarded man as the highest possible being which evolution\n",
      "could arrive at; for though his physical development may have reached\n",
      "its limit, this is not the case with his mental or spiritual attributes.\n",
      "If the process be a fact; if things have BECOME what they are, then, he\n",
      "contends, we may describe no limit to man’s aspirations. If he struggled\n",
      "up from barbarism, and still more remotely from the lower Primates,\n",

      "intellectual matters, he could not even think that men are equal. “With\n",
      "these preachers of equality will I not be mixed up and confounded. For\n",
      "thus speaketh justice unto ME: ‘Men are not equal.’” He sees precisely\n",
      "in this inequality a purpose to be served, a condition to be exploited.\n",
      "“Every elevation of the type ‘man,’” he writes in “Beyond Good and\n",

      "whole school of thought by a single fitting nickname may perhaps lead to\n",
      "a little confusion at first; but, as a rule, when the general drift\n",
      "of his arguments is grasped, it requires but a slight effort of the\n",
      "imagination to discover whom he is referring to. In the ninth paragraph\n",
      "of the Prologue, for instance, it is quite obvious that “Herdsmen” in\n",
      "the verse “Herdsmen, I say, etc., etc.,” stands for all those to-day\n",
      "who are the advocates of gregariousness—of the ant-hill. And when our\n",
      "author says: “A robber shall Zarathustra be called by the herdsmen,” it\n",
      "is clear that these words may be taken almost literally from one whose\n",
      "ideal was the rearing of a higher aristocracy. Again, “the good and\n",
      "just,” throughout the book, is the expression used in referring to the\n",
      "self-righteous of modern times,—those who are quite sure that they\n",
      "know all that is to be known concerning good and evil, and are satisfied\n",
      "that the values their little world of tradition has handed down to them,\n",
      "are destined to rule mankind as long as it lasts.\n",

      "\n",
      "This opening discourse is a parable in which Zarathustra discloses the\n",
      "mental development of all creators of new values. It is the story of\n",
      "a life which reaches its consummation in attaining to a second\n",
      "ingenuousness or in returning to childhood. Nietzsche, the supposed\n",
      "anarchist, here plainly disclaims all relationship whatever to anarchy,\n",
      "for he shows us that only by bearing the burdens of the existing law and\n",
      "submitting to it patiently, as the camel submits to being laden, does\n",
      "the free spirit acquire that ascendancy over tradition which enables him\n",
      "to meet and master the dragon “Thou shalt,”—the dragon with the values\n",
      "of a thousand years glittering on its scales. There are two lessons in\n",
      "this discourse: first, that in order to create one must be as a little\n",
      "child; secondly, that it is only through existing law and order that\n",
      "one attains to that height from which new law and new order may be\n",
      "promulgated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter II. The Academic Chairs of Virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost the whole of this is quite comprehensible. It is a discourse\n",
      "against all those who confound virtue with tameness and smug ease, and\n",
      "who regard as virtuous only that which promotes security and tends to\n",
      "deepen sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter IV. The Despisers of the Body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Zarathustra gives names to the intellect and the instincts; he\n",
      "calls the one “the little sagacity” and the latter “the big sagacity.”\n",
      " Schopenhauer’s teaching concerning the intellect is fully endorsed here.\n",
      "“An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother,\n",
      "which thou callest ‘spirit,’” says Zarathustra. From beginning to end it\n",
      "is a warning to those who would think too lightly of the instincts\n",

      "Chapter XV. The Thousand and One Goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this discourse Zarathustra opens his exposition of the doctrine of\n",
      "relativity in morality, and declares all morality to be a mere means\n",
      "to power. Needless to say that verses 9, 10, 11, and 12 refer to the\n",
      "Greeks, the Persians, the Jews, and the Germans respectively. In the\n",
      "penultimate verse he makes known his discovery concerning the root of\n",

      "Chapter XVIII. Old and Young Women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nietzsche’s views on women have either to be loved at first sight\n",
      "or they become perhaps the greatest obstacle in the way of those who\n",
      "otherwise would be inclined to accept his philosophy. Women especially,\n",
      "of course, have been taught to dislike them, because it has been\n",
      "rumoured that his views are unfriendly to themselves. Now, to my mind,\n",
      "all this is pure misunderstanding and error.\n",
      "\n",
      "German philosophers, thanks to Schopenhauer, have earned rather a bad\n",
      "name for their views on women. It is almost impossible for one of them\n",
      "to write a line on the subject, however kindly he may do so, without\n",
      "being suspected of wishing to open a crusade against the fair sex.\n",
      "Despite the fact, therefore, that all Nietzsche’s views in this respect\n",
      "were dictated to him by the profoundest love; despite Zarathustra’s\n",
      "reservation in this discourse, that “with women nothing (that can be\n",
      "said) is impossible,” and in the face of other overwhelming evidence\n",
      "to the contrary, Nietzsche is universally reported to have mis son\n",
      "pied dans le plat, where the female sex is concerned. And what is the\n",
      "fundamental doctrine which has given rise to so much bitterness and\n",
      "aversion?—Merely this: that the sexes are at bottom ANTAGONISTIC—that\n",
      "is to say, as different as blue is from yellow, and that the best\n",
      "possible means of rearing anything approaching a desirable race is to\n",
      "preserve and to foster this profound hostility. What Nietzsche strives\n",
      "to combat and to overthrow is the modern democratic tendency which is\n",
      "slowly labouring to level all things—even the sexes. His quarrel is not\n",
      "with women—what indeed could be more undignified?—it is with those who\n",
      "would destroy the natural relationship between the sexes, by modifying\n",
      "either the one or the other with a view to making them more alike. The\n",
      "human world is just as dependent upon women’s powers as upon men’s. It\n",
      "is women’s strongest and most valuable instincts which help to determine\n",
      "who are to be the fathers of the next generation. By destroying these\n",
      "particular instincts, that is to say by attempting to masculinise woman,\n",
      "and to feminise men, we jeopardise the future of our people. The general\n",
      "democratic movement of modern times, in its frantic struggle to mitigate\n",
      "all differences, is now invading even the world of sex. It is against\n",
      "this movement that Nietzsche raises his voice; he would have woman\n",
      "become ever more woman and man become ever more man. Only thus, and\n",
      "he is undoubtedly right, can their combined instincts lead to the\n",
      "excellence of humanity. Regarded in this light, all his views on woman\n",
      "appear not only necessary but just (see Note on Chapter LVI., par. 21.)\n",

      "It is interesting to observe that the last line of the discourse, which\n",
      "has so frequently been used by women as a weapon against Nietzsche’s\n",

      "man with overflowing strength, both of mind and body, who must discharge\n",
      "this strength or perish, is the Nietzschean ideal. To such a man, giving\n",

      "himself in the mirror of public opinion, and recoils terrified from the\n",
      "distorted reflection of his features. In verse 20 he gives us a\n",
      "hint which it were well not to pass over too lightly; for, in the\n",
      "introduction to “The Genealogy of Morals” (written in 1887) he finds it\n",
      "necessary to refer to the matter again and with greater precision. The\n",
      "point is this, that a creator of new values meets with his surest and\n",
      "strongest obstacles in the very spirit of the language which is at his\n",

      "Now, the original thinker who finds himself compelled to use the current\n",

      "which it is totally unfitted to perform,—hence the obscurities and\n",
      "prolixities which are so frequently met with in the writings of original\n",

      "teaching here is quite clear. He was among the first thinkers of Europe\n",
      "to overcome the pessimism which godlessness generally brings in its\n",
      "wake. He points to creating as the surest salvation from the suffering\n",
      "which is a concomitant of all higher life. “What would there be to\n",

      "will meet, is an interesting one. The former says in his “Origin of\n",
      "Species”, concerning the causes of variability: “...there are two\n",
      "factors, namely, the nature of the organism, and the nature of the\n",
      "conditions. THE FORMER SEEMS TO BE MUCH THE MORE IMPORTANT (The italics\n",
      "are mine.), for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under, as\n",
      "far as we can judge, dissimilar conditions; and on the other hand,\n",
      "dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be\n",

      "of environment. Adaptation, according to him, is merely a secondary\n",
      "activity, a mere re-activity, and he is therefore quite opposed to\n",
      "Spencer’s definition: “Life is the continuous adjustment of internal\n",
      "relations to external relations.” Again in the motive force behind\n",
      "animal and plant life, Nietzsche disagrees with Darwin. He\n",
      "transforms the “Struggle for Existence”—the passive and involuntary\n",
      "condition—into the “Struggle for Power,” which is active and creative,\n",
      "and much more in harmony with Darwin’s own view, given above, concerning\n",

      "“struggle for existence,” is to state the case inadequately. He warns us\n",

      "Wagner, as the type in this discourse, almost inevitable. Most readers\n",
      "will be acquainted with the facts relating to Nietzsche’s and Wagner’s\n",
      "friendship and ultimate separation. As a boy and a youth Nietzsche had\n",

      "grew passionately fond of it. Long before he met Wagner he must have\n",
      "idealised him in his mind to an extent which only a profoundly artistic\n",
      "nature could have been capable of. Nietzsche always had high ideals for\n",
      "humanity. If one were asked whether, throughout his many changes, there\n",
      "was yet one aim, one direction, and one hope to which he held fast,\n",
      "one would be forced to reply in the affirmative and declare that aim,\n",
      "direction, and hope to have been “the elevation of the type man.”\n",
      " Now, when Nietzsche met Wagner he was actually casting about for an\n",

      "remember his youth (he was twenty-one when he was introduced to Wagner),\n",
      "his love of Wagner’s music, and the undoubted power of the great\n",
      "musician’s personality, in order to realise how very uncritical his\n",

      "attention and love, and we are therefore not surprised to find him\n",
      "pressing Wagner forward as the great Reformer and Saviour of mankind.\n",
